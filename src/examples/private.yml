  To use this orb with a private repository on your main branch, you need to grant the orb access to your CircleCI API. You can do this by creating an environment variable called `CIRCLE_API_TOKEN` in the context or the project.
  Notice how the steps are exactly same as the default one. The remaining usage code is intentionally omitted, since it does not differ from the normal usage.

  Note: It should be a user token, not project token.
usage:
  version: 2.1
  orbs:
    nx: nrwl/nx@1.1.4
