description: >
  To use this orb with a private repository on your main branch, you need to grant the orb access to your CircleCI API.
  You can do this by creating an environment variable called `CIRCLE_API_TOKEN` in the context or the project.
  The remaining usage code is intentionally omitted, since it does not differ from the normal usage.

  Note: It should be a user token, not project token.
usage:
  version: 2.1
  orbs:
    nx: nrwl/nx@1.6.2
