  You need to specify `main-branch-name` if different than `main`.
  If last successful workflow run was not found, by default we report warning and fallback to HEAD~1.
  You can instead make this a hard error by settting 'error-on-no-successful-workflow' to true.
  If you need to find a successful workflow with a specific name, set the value of 'workflow-name'.
