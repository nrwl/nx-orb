  You need to specify `main-branch-name` if different than `main`.
  If last successful workflow run was not found, by default we report warning and fallback to HEAD~1.
  You can instead make this a hard error by settting 'error-on-no-successful-workflow' to true.
  If you need to find the last successful job within a specific workflow, set the value of 'workflow-name'.
  By default we check for `success` state of the workflow. If you would like to include also `on_hold` states,
  you can do so by enabling `allow-on-hold-workflow`.

  version: 2.1
  orbs:
    nx: nrwl/nx@1.5.0
  jobs:
    build:
      docker:
        - image: cimg/node:14.17-browsers
      environment:
        MAIN_BRANCH_NAME: master # environment variable has priority over command variable
      steps:
        - checkout
        - run:
            name: Install dependencies
            command: yarn install --frozen-lockfile
        - nx/set-shas:
            main-branch-name: "master" # you can also use the environment variable MAIN_BRANCH_NAME for this purpose
            error-on-no-successful-workflow: true
            workflow-name: "nx-pipeline"
            allow-on-hold-workflow: true
        - run:
